<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thi</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">s weekend marks the start of Fairtrade Fortnight (23rd Feb to 7th March 2015) so this is a post which takes an engineer's perspective on what Fairtrade is all about. Later this week, I'll be considering the history of Fairtrade, and particularly how people of faith have played their part in bringing Fairtrade from niche to mainstream.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ewS2ePSeYqc/VOjuL2neJGI/AAAAAAAAAHA/VIS9hP0gu2k/s1600/f14_2015%2Bgreen%2Brgb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ewS2ePSeYqc/VOjuL2neJGI/AAAAAAAAAHA/VIS9hP0gu2k/s1600/f14_2015%2Bgreen%2Brgb.jpg" height="400" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />I've supported the Fairtrade movement since I was a teenager (indeed, my first ever campaign was to turn my high school Fairtrade with assemblies, displays and Fairtrade chocolate in the vending machines).<br />That means I've always been keenly aware of the difference Fairtrade makes: rather than an exploitative relationship between individual farmers and big retailers (with several middlemen taking their cut),</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Fair trade is…a pragmatic response to unsatisfactory outcomes of the market by changing the nature of trading relationships…" (Judith Sugden)</i></span><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i> </i></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Long term relationships based on fair prices which are based on the cost of production rather than wildly variable commodity markets give farmers security which allows them to invest in better tools and seeds, improvements to drainage or farming methods.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For crops produced on large plantations (tea, sugar) rather than individual smallholdings (coffee, cacao), Fairtrade standards require robust protection for workers, from fair pay and working conditions to ensuring workers are not exposed to pesticides. <br />There is also the Fairtrade premium, a small sum per kilo paid in addition to the price of the crop to the farmers' cooperative. The cooperative decides the best use of the money: schools or healthcare centres, a village well, better roads to take goods to market or investment in the farms: training, storage, processing facilities. This means that Fairtrade enables poor communities around the world to invest in essential infrastructure - a great message given that this week I was talking to the leader of the Green Party about the importance of investing in infrastructure!</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />So what's happening in York to celebrate Fairtrade Fortnight?
