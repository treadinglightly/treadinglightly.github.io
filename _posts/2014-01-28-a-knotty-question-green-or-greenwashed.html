I set myself <a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/2014-challenge.html" target="_blank">the challenge this month</a> of reading my company's annual sustainability report. There's some great stuff in here which we can be justly proud of. We are one of the world's biggest environmental and engineering consultants, with some impressive stories from low carbon buildings to new wastewater treatment plants that can remove much higher proportions of pollutants such as nitrates from sewage and capture methane from solid sludge as a source of energy for the plant. We have also worked with councils to change user behaviour when it comes to waste and divert 95% of waste away from landfill. We have committed to WRAP's commitment to halve the volume of construction waste arising from our projects which goes to landfill.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />As well as expertise in ecology, heritage/archaeology and the planning process (including public consultations), we have a number of qualified people who can help projects achieve recognised best practice standards for environmentally friendly buildings (BREEAM or LEED) and civil engineering projects (CEEQUAL). One good idea I spotted was a company headquarters building with a staff cafe where everyone gets a discount if they use a mug rather than a takeaway container. We could try that one at Network Rail's coffee shop/canteen in York!<br />However, the report as a whole brings me back to a knotty question: to what extent is it ethically acceptable to help highly-polluting companies to become slightly more sustainable, while never appearing to challenge their core business approach? <br />On the one hand, I have a great respect for those who work on coal-fired power plants built in the 1960s, since I spend a week or so every quarter extracting water from boreholes and getting it independently tested for a range of pollutants as part of the stringent licensing arrangement with the Environment Agency. On the other, I recommend we don't build any more!<br />The sustainability report made me wonder if we should really be proud of our efforts to help a major UK airport to install a very impressive biomass combined heat and power plant (using only renewable timber grown within a 50 mile radius). The airport has an target it regards as ambitious to reduce carbon emissions from its buildings by 34% by 2020 (compared to 1990). But this smacks of missing the point.<br />Like a petrol station with solar panels in the roof, why bother saving 13,000kg of carbon a year on buildings if the airport intend to significantly expand the number of flights over the same period, supported by new runways and terminal buildings? That's the equivalent of just one passenger flying to New Zealand and back, not even one full long-haul plane-load! When each short-haul flight means 250kg of carbon per passenger and long-haul ones can result in thousands of kg per passenger, surely addressing the number of flights should be the major definition of whether they are becoming more sustainable?<br />Similarly is it OK to help a Saudi oil company to invest in better refineries which reduce pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide from diesel and petrol? Or to work on oil sands mines in Alberta, an unconventional oil source which has been responsible for horrific destruction of ancient forests across Canada and extensive water pollution?<br />Given that we cannot burn more than half the conventional fossil fuels without risking runaway climate change, and therefore a good part of the current balance sheets of our clients would be written off, should we not be advising strongly against continued oil extraction or guiding our clients towards renewable investments which will secure their prosperity for the long term?<br />Obviously, I believe we should make all industries as non-polluting as possible, and it makes little sense to avoid helping the worst offenders to improve due to a sense of moral outrage. However, my company is proud of the long-term relationships it has built with our clients, so why not use those relationships to help our clients move towards different modes of business that will put them on a secure footing for the long term, not just business as usual that will eventually bankrupt them when the oil runs out and severely polluting activities are taxed in a way that reflects the real damage being done?<br /><br /><b>See also:</b><br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/climate-politics-where-are-we-now.html" target="_blank">Climate politics - breaking the silence</a></li><li><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/what-wonderful-world.html" target="_blank">What a wonderful world!</a></li></ul><br /><br />
