<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>This is the third in a series of posts about my role in the choir in<a href="http://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk%2Fevent%2Fin_fog_and_falling_snow.php%26ei%3Dxmrwvbpqi8pb7gauoigwcq%26usg%3Dafqjcnecttihrsagvrpjwmfh-mfmzc-brw%26sig2%3Drppaju0zukyokvtledoetw%26bvm%3Dbv.94911696%2Cbs.1%2Cd.bgg/"> York Theatre Royal's production In Fog and Falling Snow </a>(26th June to 11th July).

Ask most adults, and you’ll get the same three answers, with the possible addition of “the man who opens the level crossing gate at Poppleton station” (in places with </span><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/rail-electrification-at-last-for-north.html" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" target="_blank">antiquated signalling systems like the Harrogate line!</a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">) or “manufacturing trains” (especially if you happen to ask people in places like Stafford, Derby or York with a long history of train building, although the </span><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/972f7360-89fa-11e4-9b5f-00144feabdc0.html" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" target="_blank">UK's biggest train factory opened earlier this year in County Durham</a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Hitachi Rail Europe has won a £5.7bn contract to supply the intercity express programme" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/dc642433-8a8a-4707-af9a-4c77efeda06a.img" height="180" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Hitachi's new IEP train, being manufactured<br />in County Durham and coming soon<br />to a mainline near you!</i></span></b></td></tr></tbody></table><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I mentioned <a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/in-fog-1-yorks-railway-history-on-stage.html" target="_blank">previously in this series </a>that since York’s carriage building workshops closed down, the rail workforce has been spread around the city’s offices out of sight, so many people don’t realise that the rail industry still employs thousands of York (and Yorkshire)’s brightest and best. So here’s just a few of the more unusual jobs that happen behind the scenes here in York. If you want to know more, <a href="http://www.tomorrowsengineers.org.uk/Transport/" target="_blank">see the great videos here</a> (including my friend Philippa Jefferis!).</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><span lang="EN-AU" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><u><br /></u></b><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><u>Operations</u></b></div></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;">Psychologist</b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The biggest cause of safety incidents on the railway is human error. So how can we predict what a driver will do when she’s done this route 50 times, but today something is different? Or whether the many alarms and flashing lights on a signaller’s workstation will lead to action or just distraction, with too many things to concentrate on at once? Or how a crowd of passengers will behave in an emergency situation? Railway safety depends on psychologists who are experts in human behaviour and can ensure that systems work as designed when faced with real human beings!</span></span><br /><a name='more'></a><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;">Web designer</b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The last time you bought a train ticket, I bet you didn’t buy it at a ticket office. On your phone or a computer? Or using a ticket machine? So developing websites and passenger information systems that provide useful information for planning journeys and during disruption is vital. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It’s important for other customers too, like supermarkets who want to get their containers of fruit or clothing delivered to their warehouse just in time as they do using road transport. Last week I heard a great talk from DB Schenker, one of Europe’s biggest freight operators about how to provide innovative train planning and logistics tools via web apps to integrate train movements with warehouse stock levels and vastly improve customer service (compared to 10 years ago when most freight carried on the rail network was coal or steel, and no-one much cares if that arrives half an hour late). <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then there is the Digital Railway and ORBIS projects, which use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or 3D modelling to give rail staff the best possible information about the network in a form which is easily searchable. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span><br /><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><b>Signalling or electrical controller</b></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Controlling the signals and the electricity supply is what keeps all of us safe on the railway, so it’s a challenging and well paid job. Rather than pulling levers in a distant signalbox somewhere, today’s signalling workforce is being moved to Rail Operating Centres like the one just completed at York, using screens to monitor train movements over a wide area and communicate with drivers, level crossings and the electrical controls.</span></span></div></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><b>Delay attribution</b></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We have a highly regulated rail network, so if a train is late or cancelled, there is a fine to pay. But who pays it? That depends whether it was a fault with the train (which would be the operator’s fault), with the train in front (another operator’s fault but not necessarily the same company) or with the track or signalling, for example speed restrictions or engineering work that overran (Network Rail’s responsibility). One of the downsides of a privatised rail network is that we end up employing rather a large number of people to argue about these things between all the different parties…</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><u>Maintenance</u></b></span></div></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><b>Train maintenance</b></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Obviously trains need maintenance as much as the track, but they’re pretty complicated pieces of kit nowadays, with air conditioning, lighting, heating, a kitchen, on-board electrical equipment, engines, wheels and plumbing to worry about, not to mention the wifi and customer information screens.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><b>Asset manager</b></span></div><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The railway network is vast, with thousands of miles of track, bridges, stations, embankments, electrical equipment etc, which deteriorate over time at different rates but &nbsp;need to be maintained in working condition at all times. How do we ensure that money is spent wisely and is targeted at the most critical locations to give the best performance? Network Rail as an organisation owns these assets, but each one is personally “owned” as well by an asset manager, who is a specialist in a particular asset type such as earthworks (a geotechnical engineer) and has responsibility for everything in her patch, which is usually vast (as you can see here).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>See also</b></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"></div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/in-fog-1-yorks-railway-history-on-stage.html" target="_blank">In Fog 1: York's Railway History on Stage</a></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/in-fog-2-engineer-who-loves-to-sing.html" target="_blank">In Fog 2: An Engineer Who Loves to Sing</a></span></li><li><a href="http://www.tomorrowsengineers.org.uk/Transport/" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" target="_blank">Tomorrow's Engineers - a great resource about engineering careers you'd never thought of&nbsp;</a></li></ul>
