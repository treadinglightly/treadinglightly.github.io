This post is a summary of my challenges for January, because it helps to be specific.<br /><em><strong>Personal:</strong>&nbsp;</em>I will calculate my carbon footprint and publish the results. This will act as a steer for future months' challenges by highlighting the areas where I can achieve the most significant reductions.<br /><em><strong>Political:</strong></em> I will write a letter to my MP as part of<a href="http://www.ageuk.org.uk/health-wellbeing/keeping-your-body-healthy/preventing-winter-deaths/"> Age UK's 'Spread the Warmth' campaign </a>calling for measures to improve insulation for people on low incomes. This is really important, because Age UK's estimates indicate about 24,000 elderly people will die this winter unnecessarily because they cannot afford to heat their homes. Given that research indicates that the UK has the leakiest homes in Europe (letting more than 3 times more heat out of the average house wall than houses in Sweden, for example), we need to act.<br /><br /><em><strong>Engineering:</strong> </em>As I noted previously, this requires some research. So this month my challenge is to read my company's sustainability report and two &nbsp;recently published reports about low carbon infrastructure: "Construction 2025" and "Decarbonising Infrastructure".<br /><em><strong>Prayer:</strong> </em>This is a commitment to pray daily for an effective response to tackle climate change. This problem is much bigger than me, and I want to work with the creator of everything so prayer is absolutely key. To that end, I have signed up to Christian Ecology Link's prayer community and I'll be using their daily prayer guide to help me pray.<br /><br />
