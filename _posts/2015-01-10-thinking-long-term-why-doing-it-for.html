It has been posited that as a direct appeal to people's emotions, this is a strong motivation for people to act. Unfortunately, the evidence doesn't seem to support this view. <a name='more'></a>There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it seems to immediately exclude anyone who is childless (ie most people under 30, including me). Secondly, talking about the next generation means most people think its an issue that will affect someone else in 10 years' time, so it provides a convenient way to file environmental problems under the heading of "not now, dear". We need to find different ways to talk about climate change and biodiversity loss that effectively communicate why these are very <a href="http://www.wri.org/blog/2011/11/five-takeaways-ipcc-report-extreme-weather-and-climate-change">real issues affecting real people right now</a>: Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the Somerset Levels, most of the population of Holland where my parents live at risk from rising sea levels.<br /></span><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Put bluntly, if my parents' generation had actually been motivated by "doing it for the children", why on earth have they done nothing about climate change for the last 25 years? We have known the severity of the problem and the need for significant changes to our lifestyle and energy systems since the first IPCC report was published back in 1990, and recent analysis has demonstrated that the predictions made in 1990 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/10/1990-ipcc-report_n_2270453.html">have been borne out by observed changes in weather since then</a>. The climate talks in Lima this year mark the 22nd year of trying to get an international solution to this, and there is still little sign of progress. <br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So let's be clear about this: back when I was 7 years old, the world started talking about this problem and my parents' generation have been studiously ignoring it while actually INCREASING their energy consumption ever since. What makes you think that my generation will do any better, now we're old enough to have children of our own?<br /></span><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><b><u>Reference:</u><o:p></o:p></b></span></div><i style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Sustainable Infrastructure: Principles into Practice, Charles Ainger and Richard Fenner, ICE Publishing, 2014</i><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b> See also: </b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/climate-politics-where-are-we-now.html">Climate Politics: Where Are We Now?</a> </li><li><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/building-sustainable-infrastructure-1.html">Sustainable Infrastructure - overview</a> </li><li><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/what-is-infrastructure-for-social-and.html" target="_blank">What is Infrastructure For?
