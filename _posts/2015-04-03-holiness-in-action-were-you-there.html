<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fellow blogger Beth Routledge has been writing eloquently this week about <a href="https://wanderingmedic.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/return-to-the-lord-your-god/" target="_blank">our need to live out the drama of Easter</a>, to experience the emotions and set the reality of God’s story in our hearts as well as our heads. Holy Week starts with Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem in time for the Passover feast, where Jesus and his whole community were not only a retelling of the story of the Jewish people being liberated from slavery under the Egyptians, but reliving it with unleavened bread, sandals on your feet and ready to leave quickly to start a new life in freedom.<br /><br />Indeed, the story began long before this point as I have been reminded by following the tradition of reading Luke’s gospel from start to finish during Holy Week. After Jesus’ closest friends realised who he really was and Peter declared he was the Messiah, he started telling them what would happen to him but they couldn’t take it in. He set his face towards Jerusalem and there are 12 chapters of story telling what happened along the way – challenging stereotypes with stories like the Good Samaritan and the prodigal son, staying with friends like Mary and Martha and teaching the crowds who came to see him. </span><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then there was the last supper, the poignant Passover meal where his friends couldn’t take in the danger he was in or recognise the one who would betray him. After hours spent pleading with God to find another way, <a href="https://wanderingmedic.wordpress.com/2015/04/03/confession/" target="_blank">Judas found him in the garden</a> and led the authorities to him. A travesty of justice ensued in the middle of the night, a trial where no justice was done and Jesus was handed over to cruel Roman soldiers to be beaten, whipped and spat at as they mocked him.   <br /><br />This time last year, I led a service for Good Friday in York Minster as chair of Churches Together in York. After we had carried a huge wooden cross through York’s city centre to the Minster, we prayed and sang as we carried a bier down into the crypt to remember his burial. I was shown a place to stand at the east end of the Minster where no microphone is needed to make the whole building resound with song. Imagine a solo voice singing, reverberating around the ancient walls:</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Were you there when they crucified my Lord?</i></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today is Good Friday, a day of mourning and sorrow as it seems that evil and injustice have triumphed. The one we loved has been murdered by a combination of envious religious leaders and a cruel Roman occupation force, and our hopes in the Messiah have been dashed. This is a day of wearing black from head to toe, of mourning and fasting and seeking God through the time when the sky went black for three hours in the middle of the day. </span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?</i></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Were you listening to hear his last words with those who stood around his cross to see how it ended? Do you remember how he cried out for God to forgive even those who had killed him, and when he asked his friend John to take his widowed mother Mary into his home and look after her?</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?</i></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Were you there when all hope was gone, when the mourning started in earnest? Family tombs were expensive when they were hewn out of the rock for you, but one rich man, Joseph, came to offer his own to Jesus. Weeping, his friends and family took him down and laid him there just before night fell and went home as the Sabbath began.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>See also:</b></span><br /><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/holiness-in-action-girl-in-black.html" target="_blank">Holiness in Action: The Girl in Black</a></b></span></li><li><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://wanderingmedic.wordpress.com/2015/04/03/confession/" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" target="_blank">A Confession (Beth Routledge)</a></b></li><li><a href="http://blog.arocha.org/post/how-big-is-your-jesus/" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" target="_blank"><b>How Big is Your Jesus?
