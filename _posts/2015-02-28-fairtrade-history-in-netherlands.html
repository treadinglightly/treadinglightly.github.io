<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yesterday I visited a little piece of Fairtrade history: while visiting my parents in Leiden,<a href="http://www.wereldwinkels.nl/over-ons" target="_blank"> we visited the Wereld Winkel, literally "world shop"</a>. Wereld Winkel was the world's first ever Fairtrade shop, founded in the Netherlands in 1969 and now has 250 branches across the country. The focus was upon fairly traded handicrafts that give people the chance to use traditional skills to create products for the Western market. However, this was relatively limited in its impact at first, since a lot of learning was required on both sides to predict what people wanted to buy (with variable strands in fashion) and to achieve the quality that consumers desired in return for the slightly higher price.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nSuj6EdCfuw/VPIfk_gjqmI/AAAAAAAAAHk/ROHK2W-c5Rg/s1600/Max_Havelaar.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nSuj6EdCfuw/VPIfk_gjqmI/AAAAAAAAAHk/ROHK2W-c5Rg/s1600/Max_Havelaar.gif" /></span></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Max Havelaar, the first Fairtrade mark</span></b></td></tr></tbody></table><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">York is home to a groundbreaking Fairtrade shop too: <a href="http://www.sharedearth.co.uk/acatalog/about_us.html" target="_blank">Shared Earth was founded in York as one of the first UK retailer</a>s to follow in the footsteps of Wereld Winkel in 1986, with a similar range of wares: predominantly craft items and clothing.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One major change in buying habits over the last 45 years was the move towards Fairtrade food as well as crafts: firstly long-life products like tea, coffee and chocolate and then more recently perishable items like bananas. Initially, fairly traded tea and coffee were only available in ethical shops like the Wereld Winkel or via stalls like the one I set up at my church aged 17, because there was otherwise no way for consumers to tell whether food sold in supermarkets or elsewhere was fairly traded.&nbsp;</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br /><a name='more'></a></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The next major innovation was also Dutch: "Max Havelaar" was the first ever Fairtrade label, launched in 1988, selling coffee from Mexico. This was initiated by a sharp descent in world coffee prices which meant there was now a serious risk that coffee farmers could be paid less than the coffee actually cost to produce. The name "Max Havelaar" came from a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee pickers in Dutch colonies (a book published in 1859). &nbsp;</span></div><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KrZgJDOaZSg/VPIfgYRYTcI/AAAAAAAAAHc/ZXYqGI2YABk/s1600/max_havelaar_fairtrade_logo-a840x630.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KrZgJDOaZSg/VPIfgYRYTcI/AAAAAAAAAHc/ZXYqGI2YABk/s1600/max_havelaar_fairtrade_logo-a840x630.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></span></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><b><i>The new Dutch Fairtrade logo still includes<br />Max Havelaar!</i></b></span></td></tr></tbody></table><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The new label offered mainstream coffee industry players the opportunity to adopt a standardized system of Fair Trade criteria, and allowed consumers to be confident that products met stringent conditions to ensure justice for poor farmers. The Max Havelaar initiative proved so successful that <a href="http://www.fairtrade.net/history-of-fairtrade.html" target="_blank">the UK Fairtrade Foundation was founded in 1992</a> by a group of charities including Traidcraft, Christian Aid and Oxfam.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fairtrade logo has gone through several different designs but is now internationally recognised and widely available in mainstream shops. I was interested to find this week that in the Netherlands, the Fairtrade logo still includes "Max Havelaar" beneath!</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The effect has been dramatic: while in 1992 the vast majority of fairly traded products (80%) were handicrafts, last year 80% of a much larger market of Fairtrade products were food items and only one in five were craft items.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You can find out more about one of our favourite Fairtrade products, chocolate, at a special event at Aroma cafe in Haxby, York on Thurs 5th March, 7:30pm. Don't miss out on the chance to taste a variety of different chocolate treats and hear stories from the producers.
