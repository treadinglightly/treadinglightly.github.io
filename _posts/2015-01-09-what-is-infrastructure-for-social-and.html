<div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Principle 2: Social and economic development</span></b></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>‘If you’re asking me to choose between conservation and development, I’m going to choose development every time.'</i> <a href="http://blog.arocha.org/post/reconciling-conservation-and-development/">Community worker in Democratic Republic of Congo</a><br /><br />This is part of a series <a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.com/2014/12/building-sustainable-infrastructure-1.html">inspired by the book Sustainable Infrastructure. </a>What is infrastructure for? And do we really have to make a choice between meeting people's needs and protecting the environment, as the quote above suggests?&nbsp;</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The purpose of most infrastructure is to improve social or economic outcomes (and let's face it, when one third of the world's people have no access to sanitation, there's no shortage of need) and that's why economic issues have traditionally been the biggest influence over project scoping and delivery. <br /><br />For example, many projects are justified on the basis of a cost-benefit ratio, which may consider only benefits within the organisation (<a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/towards-sustainable-railway-part-1.html">eg reduced maintenance and operation costs for a railway</a>) or may additional calculate the wider economic benefits to users (eg <a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/should-environmentalist-support-hs2.html">the business case for HS2</a>).</span><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But the social dimension has been the least studied and often overlooked aspect of sustainable development, which includes basic human needs such as housing as well as culture, education and skills and human rights. Sustainable Infrastructure discusses a number of different social and economic objectives for infrastructure, which have several possible modes of response: directly meeting needs (eg build a new road), indirectly addressing issues through how projects are delivered (eg train apprentices, use local labour/suppliers) and social outcomes (eg aim to attract apprentices from disadvantaged groups).&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="background: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><u>Goals typically served directly as outputs of infrastructure projects </u><o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background: white; color: #222222;">Sustainable Infrastructure (ref 1)&nbsp;identifies</span><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="background: white;">&nbsp;7 major goals which can be addressed directly through an infrastructure response aimed at meeting a specific demand by using quantified output measures eg number of children in school, adult literacy rates, number of people undernourished or without access to an improved water supply. Where possible, other issues should be included as secondary targets eg education might attach some healthcare and food security goals as well as basic literacy. These are the basic things we need for a decent quality of life - the items starred form part of the UN's&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en" target="_blank">Human Development Index (HDI)</a>&nbsp;measure of how "developed" a country is.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The 7 direct goals are: </span></div><ul><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>food security,</strong></span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong></strong></span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>water and sanitation,</strong></span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong></strong></span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>healthcare</strong> and life expectancy*,</span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>education</strong>*,</span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>energy</strong> (both electricity and fuel for cooking);</span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>mobility</strong> (eg roads and transport infrastructure that allows people to access jobs, healthcare and buy or sell goods/services) and</span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>resilience</strong> (the ability of a system to cope with disturbance) in the face of multiple dimensions of poverty and vulnerability to disasters. This will be covered at greater length in future posts, because building in resilience against future risk, particularly climate change is now an essential requirement for all infrastructure.</span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></ul><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><u>Goals which can be delivered as broader indirect outcomes of infrastructure projects:</u></b></span><br /><ul><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><span style="font-stretch: normal;"></span></span><span style="background: white; color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>Income*</strong> (eg 1 in 5 people across the world earn less than $1.25 per day, defined using purchasing power parity rather than exchange rates)</span></span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><span style="font-stretch: normal;"></span></span><span style="background: white; color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>Employment</strong> and Jobs</span></span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>Wealth and ownership of key resources </strong>such as land and access to water supplies. Gross inequality makes it extremely difficult to achieve a fair outcome, and infrastructure policies should ensure that improved quality of life is shared with as many of the population as possible. Currently the richest 1% of adults in the world own 40% of the world’s wealth, while the poorest 3 billion people own just 1% of the wealth.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="background: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><u>Social goals</u></span></b></div><ul><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><u> </u></span><li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><span style="font-stretch: normal;"></span></span><span style="background: white; color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>Social Inequality</strong> (eg proportion of people living on less than the median income) – can be addressed through the income, jobs and wealth goals above</span></span></li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><span style="font-stretch: normal;"></span></span><span style="background: white; color: #222222; text-indent: -18pt;"><strong>Gender inequality</strong> (employment gap between men and women) – can be addressed through the income, jobs and wealth goals above.
