A generous gift of turf has meant that Janette now has a good lawn within her new hedge (where a large patch of brambles once stood!) Apart from that, the patient work of weeding and digging continues, with a growing pile of bricks and other obstructions removed from the soil. It has been a very dry spring, so the garden team has been popping round at regular intervals to water different sections of the garden, especially to encourage areas of new planting (our best protection against weeds is vigilance and planting things we WANT to grow in their place!)<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cYAWAmLkrrY/VVerODhK7VI/AAAAAAAAAOs/XJK-VoD5N4M/s1600/IMG_20150509_111810831_HDR.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="356" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cYAWAmLkrrY/VVerODhK7VI/AAAAAAAAAOs/XJK-VoD5N4M/s640/IMG_20150509_111810831_HDR.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><b>Large areas of the garden have now been dug over and planted <br />(though there's still plenty of weeding to do!)</b></td></tr></tbody></table></span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nlTzKFgR5fs/VVetHJbQCyI/AAAAAAAAAO8/Lb9igl_qNps/s1600/IMG_20150510_150222129.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nlTzKFgR5fs/VVetHJbQCyI/AAAAAAAAAO8/Lb9igl_qNps/s320/IMG_20150510_150222129.jpg" width="179" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tulips with a view of the castle</span></b></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The next step on our garden journey was our "Second Sunday Social", which this month featured a picnic and afternoon exploring <a href="http://www.helmsleywalledgarden.org.uk/" target="_blank">Helmsley Walled Garden </a>on the day our York Cards got us in for free! (The garden isn't open during the normal <a href="http://www.visityork.org/residents-festival.aspx" target="_blank">York Residents Festival</a> in late January, a fabulous weekend when we get to enjoy reduced rates being tourists in our own city, so mid-May is offered as an alternative).&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The walled garden is just below the castle (<a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/helmsley-castle/" target="_blank">an excellent attraction in its own right,</a> which I explored with my friend Hannah last year). It originally supplied the kitchens of Duncombe House, then was a market garden until 1984 when it was abandoned. After a decade of neglect, the garden was rediscovered in 1994 by a mental health nurse who dreamed of restoring the garden as a means of helping people recover.&nbsp;Therapeutic gardening is an idea which York NHS also <a href="http://treadinglightly08.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/energy-and-transport-how-railways-moved.html" target="_blank">put to good use at the Poppleton Railway Nursery (as I've written about here)</a>.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-88tYaw9QEr8/VVetHc4T3ZI/AAAAAAAAAPA/mlLfO203t9w/s1600/IMG_20150510_153918998.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="356" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-88tYaw9QEr8/VVetHc4T3ZI/AAAAAAAAAPA/mlLfO203t9w/s640/IMG_20150510_153918998.jpg" width="640" /></span></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fruit trees and gooseberry bushes along the back wall of the garden</span></b></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DtIaCfjEJeE/VVetHPkmTtI/AAAAAAAAAO4/g6Ak_0P9DIs/s1600/IMG_20150510_153307064.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DtIaCfjEJeE/VVetHPkmTtI/AAAAAAAAAO4/g6Ak_0P9DIs/s400/IMG_20150510_153307064.jpg" width="223" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Well-placed reeds, hedges and gateways<br />divide the garden&nbsp;into different spaces<br />including this "quiet" garden&nbsp;and a physic garden<br />(as recommended by John Wesley!) &nbsp;</span></b></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We thought our patch of wilderness was hard to conquer, but we were much encouraged to compare the photos of all 5 overgrown acres of Helmsley with the garden we explored on Sunday! The garden now employs two full time horticultural therapists who assist many people to rebuild their lives while tending to the flowers, fruit trees, vegetables, chickens and bees (very useful pollinators!)&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We particularly liked the way that the garden had a variety of different "rooms" with space for contemplation as well as play, and occasional interpretation boards explain some of the principles in use for organic, wildlife-friendly gardening (while still battling the perennial weeds!)&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">There is also an allotment area outside the main garden tended by a local school - like </span><a href="http://www.edibleyork.org.uk/" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;" target="_blank">Edible York's work in schools across the city</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">, they have found that one of the best ways to connect people to valuing the natural world is through food!</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The garden is a charity and social enterprise supported by entrance fees to the garden, selling some of their plants and veg at a well stocked garden center and a cafe full of vines, where we tried to drink enough coffee to make a decent contribution to the charity on our visit despite our free entry...
