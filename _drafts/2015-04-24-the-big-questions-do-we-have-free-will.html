<div class="MsoNormal">Today I was on TV in the audience for BBC1’s show “The Big Questions” at Manor School in York (broadcast Sun 19<sup>th</sup> April and available to watch on iPlayer here - LINK). The programme asked a range of panellists whether we have free will. from Guardian columnist Owen Jones (who also spoke inspiringly at the York Question Time a few weeks ago - LINK) to a Buddhist nun and a variety of positions in between<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC1]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>. The discussion approached the question from three perspectives: the religious or philosophical (are we able to make moral choices<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC2]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>?), the political or economic and the scientific/genetic (ie do the constraints of poverty, your family background, prejudice or your genes mean that you do not have free will, or at least cannot exercise it?) This post deals with the first point – I’ll be writing about the political discussion later this week.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, the debate started with two Christian speakers representing an extreme Calvinist/evangelical position<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC3]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>which I violently disagree with! <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC4]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>Fortunately <span style="font-size: 10.6666669845581px; line-height: 12.2666673660278px;">t</span>hey were not the only Christians on the panel. Their position was that God has decided everything in advance,therefore even the choices we think we make ourselves have already been known in advance, so we are not truly free. When it comes to ultimate questions, evangelicals are constantly inviting people to choose Jesus, emphasising that this choice has eternal consequences, while simultaneously claiming that only the ones God has chosen will actually respond to the invitation. <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC6]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Anyone who disagrees (as many did!) is put down<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC7]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>by claiming that we can’t possibly know what God is thinking. Who are we to question God? This seems an odd perspective for a Christian to take, since the Bible tells of how God has gone to such great lengths to provide us with stories, poetry and rules to live by which illustrate his character, including sending His own son to live among us and model what God is like, and his Holy Spirit to empower us to change where we have got stuck in the rut called “the human tendency to mess things up” (aka sin in religious circles, but we all know this one from personal experience!) So surely we’re supposed to use our brains (yes, really!) and our experience, coupled with an ongoing relationship with God himself, to make wise choices? Indeed, isn’t that what the book of Proverbs is all about? &nbsp;<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC8]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">I was very fortunate <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC9]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>that I had the chance to put an alternative view <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC10]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>as an audience member, given the hour-long format flies by with views from a dozen interesting panellists! <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC11]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>I believe that we do indeed have free will, and this is a precious gift that is ultimately what makes us human. What does this mean? It means I don’t believe that the world as it is reflects how God wants it to be, and we have a responsibility to change that<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC12]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>. Jesus taught his disciples to pray “Your Kingdom come, your will be done on Earth” which rather implies that much of what happens in our world does not reflect God’s will at all.<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC13]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span> Free will means that while we cannot choose the situations we are in<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC14]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>, we all have a moral responsibility for how we react <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC15]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>to them: do we respond <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]-->[JC16]<!--[endif]-->&nbsp;</span></span>in a way which works with God to seek the common good, or not? <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">This point is eloquently made by my friend Steve Redman, pastor of the Ark Church in York (LINK), in his book “At Least It’s Not Raining”, which I have been reading this week (LINK), where he tells the story of his son Rocky, diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer aged 4½. He wrote that on the day of that diagnosis: &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background: #F8F7FA; color: #473f3f; font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">“It would be unreal to suggest that we knew exactly what to do in the circumstances that we found ourselves in. We didn't. However, we did know some stuff – principles that we had learnt out of relationship with God. One thing we knew, was that God is good – he hasn't got it in for us, and he shows us favour.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span>Instead of allowing what happened to us to determine what we believed, we allowed what we believed to determine how we reacted to everything. We have great memories of that cancer ward, and the laughter that we shared there with Rocky. Rocky survived treatment (an achievement in itself) and we had a further year and a half of good times together, before he relapsed in January 2001.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Poverty, cancer, injustice or the destruction of entire species are not part of God’s plan and we shouldn’t roll over and accept them as being “just the way the world is”. Owen Jones pointed out that many people talk about poverty in the same terms as they talk about the weather: a bit rubbish but there’s nothing you can do about it. The problem is, this just isn’t true – the prophets and Jesus spent pages and pages talking about how poverty was an abomination in God’s sight and the entire structures of society had to change to address it, from paying your workers on time and using fair weighing scales to leaving a part of your fields to be harvested by those who were landless (known as “gleaning”). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">It was also interesting to observe how the Calvinists’ emphasis was massively on the negative, with the fear of hell mentioned far more often than the hope of heaven. &nbsp;A constant focus on the end times and the fear of hell has an unfortunate tendency to make Christians in some evangelical churches less aware of our impact on the earth or peace and justice issues. What I’m looking forward to is God’s promised renewal of the whole earth and the consummation of everything I’m working for, which I have written about in previous posts (LINK). That’s what makes it worth fighting for peace, speaking up against poverty and reflecting God’s character here and now. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">See also:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;">·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]-->At Least It’s Not Raining – information about the book<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;">·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]-->Living on purpose (post from 1<sup>st</sup> Jan)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">God Doesn’t Do Waste (post about renewal of the earth)</span></div><div><div><div class="msocomtxt" id="_com_17" language="JavaScript"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]--></div><!--[endif]--></div></div><div><div><div class="msocomtxt" id="_com_17" language="JavaScript"><!--[if !supportAnnotations]--></div><!--[endif]--></div></div>
