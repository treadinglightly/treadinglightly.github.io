<span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On Wednesday 17th June, thousands of people will be meeting their MPs at the Houses of Parliament to talk about climate change. I had toyed with the idea of going for a month or two before the election, but it's a big deal to me to use up a day's leave and buy a train ticket. But there are some things I care about deeply, which motivate me to take action. Everyone has things they love which are threatened by climate change - these are mine. The personal has become political!</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">This post gives 17&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">reasons why I am calling on Parliament to take action to negotiate a binding treaty at Paris and show international leadership. We cannot wait another 5 years for another government before we start dealing with this - whether we like the one we've got or not. These are also the reasons why I am campaigning for churches, charities like the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust and pension funds to divest immediately from fossil fuels, especially the worst polluting sources (coal, tar sands, Arctic drilling and fracking).&nbsp;</span></span><br /><ol><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Opportunity to rebuild our economy with green technology - 1bn green jobs (expand on this)</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Creation care and renewing the earth. Jesus is Lord, and we weren't supposed to wreck it!</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Oceans being acidified and the loss of the Great Barrier Reef, new WWF report (8th June - oceans day)</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Food security</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Professional integrity: As civil engineers, it's drummed into us that we don't walk by when we see something that could cause harm, whether it's tools that could fall or a newspaper on the stairs. A commitment to safety means being willing to intervene and seeing everyone as your neighbour. So how can I "walk on by" when climate change threatens the health and security of my own family as well as yours?</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For the Railways: I've written before about how one extremely wet winter (2013/14) caused over 100 landslides on the rail network. We need to prevent flooding and extreme weather by reducing carbon emissions, as well as making ourselves more resilient. (Link)</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For the good of our health: I suffer from asthma, which is exacerbated by air pollution. The biggest causes of city air pollution are diesel and petrol vehicles, followed by aeroplanes and dust-producing industry. Sustainable transport would reduce emissions close to where people live.</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I'm a coffee lover, and to me there's nothing better than a freshly ground Fairtrade cup from our coffee machine. Coffee grows at a sweet spot on mountains at high altitude, but warming temperatures mean that it's migrating up the mountains. So there's less and less land to grow coffee on.</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Active transport like cycling and walking improve both mental and physical health, and connects you to your community - if you see someone you know, you can stop for a chat. The more cars go down your street, the less likely you are to know your neighbours. Roads policy needs significant investment</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To build strong communities - Incredible Edible, Transition Towns, LILAC</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Active transport is key to better public health/obesity</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even our doctors are concerned about negative impact of extreme temperatures on public health eg 2003 heatwave, excess winter deaths. BMA will be speaking about this</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Climate change undermines our efforts to tackle poverty. Ive been a campaigner for Fairtrade and fundraiser for anti-poverty charities like Christian Aid (split these two?) since I was a teenager, but work undermined by climate change eg Malawi and Mozambique floods (link).</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Flooding wrecks lives - I spent three years building flood defences to protect Wakefield from a one in 100 year event and it happened three days after the dam started operating.

This is not just rivers but also groundwater and sea level rise.</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fuel poverty</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Stable and secure source of energy, not dependent on imports</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Water supply for UK, but also loss of glaciers threatens millions who rely on them for eater in the dry season</span></span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Holland - would I want to see entire countries full of people and places I love underwater?
