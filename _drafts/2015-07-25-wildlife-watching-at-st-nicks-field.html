Around twenty of us enjoyed a pleasant walk with the help of expert volunteers who pointed out insects, plants and birds, including frequent stops to look at things more closely or get excited about something a little way off the path.&nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">This weekend marks the start of the Big Butterfly Count, an annual fortnight-long initiative to record sightings of butterflies around the UK, and therefore understand the geographical spread and frequency of different species. Butterflies are particularly vulnerable to pollution and habitat loss, so make a useful marker for the health or otherwise of our natural world.&nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">With the help of an identifying sheet which you can download here, we spotted six kinds of butterfly: green-veined whites, large white, ringlets, a six-spotted burnet moth, gatekeeper and comma. We also found a huge southern hawker dragonfly resting on a tree (which dragonflies often do soon after hatching until their wings are dry). We saw and heard birds too: a black-headed gull, a greenfinch, a bullfinch sitting by the beck, a young dunnock, collared doves and woodpigeons.</div><div style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">The real highlight of the walk for me was seeing a family of water voles. Water voles are an endangered species, and I have read plenty of ecology reports for construction sites which have looked for potential water vole habitats, but until today I had never seen one. &nbsp;twenty minutes spent quietly watching next to Tang Hall Beck,&nbsp;</div>
